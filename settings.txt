:: 4cc aet compiler - Settings file
:: 
:: Lines starting with :: are comment lines and will be ignored by the compiler.
:: 1 means enabled, 0 means disabled. No spaces allowed next to the equal sign.
:: 
:: 
:: - Fox Mode -
:: Enable fox mode to make the compiler accept exports with files for PES18/19 instead of PES16/17
:: The fox 19 and 21 flags will set a few behaviours required by those PES versions
set fox_mode=1
set fox_19=1
set fox_21=0
:: 
:: 
:: - Cpk Name -
:: Write the package names you want without quotes (e.g. 4cc_69_nicecpk)
:: The maximum filename length you can set here is 28 characters. Spaces are fine.
set cpk_name=4cc_90_test
::
:: 
:: - Move Cpks -
:: This setting is for enabling the moving of the cpks to PES' download folder after
:: they have been created. If disabled the cpks will be put in the patches_output folder.
:: Default: 1
set move_cpks=1
:: 
:: 
:: - PES Download Folder Path -
:: This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled.
:: Set the path to the PES download folder between the quotes.
:: If PES is installed in a system folder (like the default Program Files) the compiler
:: will ask for admin permissions every time you run it.
set pes_download_folder_location="C:\Program Files (x86)\Pro Evolution Soccer 2019\download"
:: 
:: 
:: - DpFileList Updating -
:: This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled.
:: If enabled, the DpFileList file in your PES download folder will be automatically
:: updated with the entries needed for PES to load the cpks the compiler just created.
:: Although the compiler does check if updating is needed before doing it, the process
:: as a whole is a bit slow, so if you're sure you're not going to need it you can
:: disable it from here.
:: Default: 1
set dpfl_updating=1
:: 
:: 
:: - Bins Updating -
:: If enabled, the UniColor and TeamColor files in the Bin Files folder will be automatically
:: updated with entries taken from the teams' txt files and then end up in the final patch.
:: If Fox Mode is enabled, the UniformParameter file will also be updated with the settings
:: from the teams' kit config files and then included in the patch.
:: Updating the bins should only be disabled if your team has the same amount of kits as in
:: previous seasons.
:: Default: 1
set bins_updating=1
:: 
:: 
:: - Multi Cpk -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers when making cup DLC.
:: Multi cpk mode creates various cpks:
:: . Faces cpk: Faces, Portraits, Boots, Gloves, Common stuff
:: . Uniform cpk: Kit Textures, Kit Configs, Logos
:: . Bins cpk: Bin files
:: You can also set their names here (The Cpk Name setting for single cpk mode will be ignored).
set multicpk_mode=0
set faces_cpk_name=4cc_40_faces
set uniform_cpk_name=4cc_45_uniform
set bins_cpk_name=4cc_08_bins
:: 
:: 
:: - FMDL ID Editing -
:: This setting is only considered when Fox Mode is enabled.
:: When enabled the compiler will edit the texture path inside the fmdls and replace the ID
:: with the ID of the player/boots/gloves.
:: . Level 0 means disabled, you'll have to use fmdls whose paths have been edited already.
:: . Level 1 means that boots and gloves will be edited, but for faces only the hair_high fmdl
::   in each folder will be edited. This is the default choice because normally people put their
::   custom texture in face_bsm_alp, so if also the face_high fmdl were to be edited you would
::   get a weird looking neck.
:: . Level 2 means every fmdl will have their path edited. Use it only if the faces are fully custom.
:: Default: 2 :: Accepted values: 0 - 1 - 2
set fmdl_id_editing=2

:: - Compression Level -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers when making cup DLC.
:: Level 2 is only available when Fox Mode is disabled.
:: These two methods of compression make the cpk smaller, but zipping it results in the same
:: final size so use this only to save some space when the cpk is in the download folder.
:: . Level 0 means no compression, the largest cpk size and fastest compilation speed.
:: . Level 1 enables compression during the final packing, which becomes slower, and results
::   in cpks which are around half as large as the uncompressed ones.
:: . Level 2 is the highest level and makes the compiler check for unzlibbed textures and zlib
::   them individually during the extraction of the exports, after checking them. This method
::   is the slowest one the first time the compiler is run, but it results in cpks which are
::   around a third of the size of the uncompressed ones.
::   To mitigate level 2's slowness, a copy of every texture that has been zlibbed is kept in the
::   storage_zlibbed folder, and when running the compiler again only new textures are zlibbed.
::   This means that new textures with the same name as old ones will get replaced with an
::   old copy though, so deleting the export folders of previously compiled exports from the
::   storage_zlibbed folder when compiling new versions is required when using this setting.
:: In short, use level 1 if you just want a simple compression, and use level 2 if you know
:: exactly what you're doing.
:: Default: 0 :: Accepted values: 0 - 1 - 2
set compression=0
:: 
:: 
:: - Pause when Wrong -
:: This setting is for pausing the compiler every time an error in the export is found.
:: Even if disabled, a line with the team's name is added to the memelist.txt file, so that
:: you can you can check all the problems after compiling is done.
:: If this setting is on you can stop the compiler when an error is found and fix the export right
:: away then restart the compiler, without the need to wait for it to be finished compiling first.
:: Disable it if you want to leave your pc running unattended without ever stopping.
:: Default: 1
set pause_when_wrong=1
:: 
:: 
:: - Pass-through Mode -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers when making cup DLC.
:: . Level 0 makes the compiler behave normally and run all the checks for errors in the exports.
:: . Level 1 makes the compiler check for errors, but keep any broken stuff instead of deleting
::   it. It will still warn about errors though.
:: . Level 2 will skip any checks. This will make the extraction of exports run much more quickly,
::   but only use it on exports you have checked beforehand.
:: The compiler will still check if the team name is present on the teams list.
:: Default: 0 :: Accepted values: 0 - 1 - 2
set pass_through=0
:: 
:: 
:: - Forced Admin Mode -
:: This setting is only considered if Move Cpks mode is enabled.
:: The compiler checks automatically if you need admin permissions or not depending on your
:: pes install folder, but if despite that the compiler fails to move the cpks you can try
:: forcing the request of admin permissions with this setting.
:: Default: 0
set admin_mode=0
